# Kevin & Christine 2019 Wedding Site

## Overview
This repository contains the static website celebrating Kevin and Christine's 2019 wedding. The project began as a Webflow design that was exported and committed to Git for long-term safekeeping and ease of hosting. Every HTML page, stylesheet, script, image, and font that Webflow produced is stored in the repo so the site can be redeployed exactly as it originally appeared. Because nothing in the build relies on server-side rendering, the project can be hosted on any static provider or served locally without additional tooling.

## Key features
- **Informational hub:** Dedicated pages share ceremony details, registry links, travel information, and stories about the couple and their wedding party.
- **Responsive Webflow layout:** The exported markup preserves Webflow's responsive breakpoints, interactions, and typography choices so the site scales gracefully from phones to desktops.
- **Self-contained assets:** All images, fonts, and scripts referenced by the HTML live alongside the pages. No external build step or package manager is required to refresh the site.
- **Drop-in hosting:** The repo can be uploaded directly to services such as Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, or an S3 bucket with static hosting enabled.

## Repository structure
The project layout mirrors the Webflow export:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Landing page with a summary of the wedding weekend and prominent calls to action. |
| `the-couple.html`, `our-guests.html`, `our-registry.html`, `our-wedding.html`, `contact-us.html` | Supporting pages with bios, schedules, RSVP guidance, travel tips, registry links, and contact information. |
| `css/` | Stylesheets generated by Webflow, including base styles, responsive overrides, and component-specific rules. |
| `js/` | JavaScript bundles that power Webflow interactions (menus, animations, sliders). |
| `images/` | Compressed hero images, gallery photography, icons, and favicons used across the pages. |
| `fonts/` | Self-hosted font files that ensure typography remains consistent even without external CDN access. |
| `vercel.json` | Optional configuration for Vercel deployments, routing all requests to `index.html` for SPA-style navigation. |

## Getting started
You can explore or modify the site with nothing more than a modern web browser. For convenience, the steps below outline several ways to preview the content:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/kevin-and-christine-2019.git
   cd kevin-and-christine-2019
   ```
2. **Open pages directly** – Double-click `index.html` (or any other page) to view it in a browser. This approach works for quick reference but may trigger browser security warnings when loading fonts or cross-origin assets.
3. **Serve over HTTP** – Running a lightweight web server avoids CORS restrictions and mimics production hosting. Examples:
   ```bash
   # Python 3 built-in server
   python3 -m http.server 5500

   # Node.js http-server (install globally first: npm install -g http-server)
   http-server -p 5500

   # Ruby webrick server
   ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5500
   ```
   After starting a server, visit `http://localhost:5500/index.html` in your browser.

## Updating content and assets
The HTML files are the canonical source of truth. You can make edits directly in the markup or re-export from Webflow if you still have access to the original project. When updating content:

1. Adjust text or links within the relevant `.html` file.
2. Replace or add assets under `images/`, `css/`, or `js/` if a new export produces updated files.
3. Verify that image dimensions and filenames match the references in the HTML to avoid broken links.
4. Preview locally to ensure layout, animations, and responsive behavior continue to work as expected.
5. Commit the changes and redeploy to your hosting provider.

## Deployment options
Because the site is static, deployment is primarily a matter of uploading the files:

- **Vercel:** Point a new project at this repository. The included `vercel.json` file redirects all incoming routes to `index.html`, which keeps Webflow's client-side routing intact even when visitors refresh deep links.
- **Netlify / Cloudflare Pages / GitHub Pages:** Drag and drop the repository contents into the provider's dashboard or configure a build that simply copies the files to the publish directory. No build command is needed.
- **Custom hosting (S3, FTP, on-prem servers):** Upload the repo contents to your static host and ensure the server serves `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.svg`, `.woff`, and `.woff2` files with appropriate MIME types.

For all hosts, enabling HTTPS is recommended so browsers do not block Webflow's fonts or scripts.

## Maintenance tips
- **Backup exports:** If you refresh the design in Webflow, keep the previous export in version control so you can roll back if needed.
- **Accessibility & performance:** Consider running Lighthouse or similar audits after significant content updates to verify color contrast, alt text coverage, and load times remain strong.
- **Version history:** Use descriptive commit messages when adjusting wording, photos, or schedule details so you can revisit past iterations of the site.

## Contact
Questions about the code or requests for updates can be handled by opening an issue or contacting the maintainers who last touched the repository. Because the site is static, most changes involve editing HTML or refreshing assets rather than altering application logic.
